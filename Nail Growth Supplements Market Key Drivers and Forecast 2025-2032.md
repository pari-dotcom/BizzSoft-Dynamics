The increasing awareness about personal health and wellness has driven the demand for supplements that promote healthier nails. A growing consumer focus on beauty and self-care, especially among women, has led to a rise in the consumption of these supplements as part of daily health regimens. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of nail-related issues such as brittle nails, nail infections, and nail thinning is further contributing to the demand for nail growth products. As consumers seek natural and effective alternatives to chemical treatments, the market for supplements containing vitamins, biotin, collagen, and other essential minerals is expanding. In addition, the development of innovative product formulations and the increasing availability of these supplements through e-commerce platforms are expected to propel market growth. Rising disposable income, particularly in developing regions, and the growing trend of nail care as a part of overall beauty and grooming routines are also fueling the market’s expansion.
