The demand for multivitamin syrups has been increasing, driven by growing awareness regarding health and nutrition, particularly among the pediatric and geriatric populations. These consumer segments are more likely to use multivitamin supplements due to their increased need for essential vitamins and minerals. The convenience and easy consumption of multivitamin syrups, especially for children and elderly individuals who might have difficulty swallowing pills, further bolster the market's growth. Moreover, the rising prevalence of vitamin deficiencies, particularly in developing regions, has created a favorable environment for multivitamin syrup products.Another key driver is the rising preference for liquid supplements, as they are considered more effective in nutrient absorption compared to tablets or capsules. This has led to an increase in the number of new formulations catering to various age groups and health needs.
